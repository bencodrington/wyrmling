# Wyrmling: First Hunt
Terrorize the forest as a baby dragon! 

No camper is safe in this reaction- and strategy-based infinite sidescroller created in two days for [#LOWREZJAM](https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2017).

Aim for a high score while savagely devouring anything that moves, and the occasional robin egg.

Don't forget to **sneak away from enemies**, and **sneak up on prey**!

What you can eat:
-----------------

* **Birds**: difficult to approach without startling, but **worth the most points** when pounced upon.
* **Bird eggs**: they won't even see you coming.
* **Stray campers**: will run away unless you're very quiet, but they're **pretty out of shape**.

What you can't eat:
------------------

* **Spear traps**: must be **carefully** jumped over. Watch out for prickly bits.
* **Wolves**: fast and dangerous, but can't see anything **below their own noses**. Sneak until they're out of sight.

At a score of **200**, you level up! With increased speed and jumping ability, you can snap birds out of the air, and soar backwards over charging wolves.
